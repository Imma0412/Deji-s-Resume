<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src=".\pictures\deji.jpg" alt="A boy", height="270">
<p>Hello, I’m a web developer with a passion for building modern, user-focused websites and applications. I specialize in creating clean, 
responsive, and accessible frontends, and I enjoy working across the full stack to bring ideas to life — from concept to launch.</p>

<p>I believe the best websites do more than just look good — they’re fast, intuitive, and built with purpose. Whether I’m coding a sleek landing page, optimizing site performance,
or integrating backend services, I aim for solutions that are both technically sound and user-friendly.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worked with technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React,
 Next.js, and Node.js. I’m constantly learning and evolving my skill set to stay up to date with the latest tools and best 
 practices in web development.</p>

<p>Beyond the code, I care deeply about the why behind the work — understanding goals, 
solving real problems, and delivering experiences that actually matter to users.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, you might find me exploring new tech, reading up on UI/UX trends,
 or tinkering with side projects.</p>

<p>If you're looking for someone who can build solid, thoughtful websites from the ground up — let’s connect.</p>
